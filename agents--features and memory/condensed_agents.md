- Focus on production-ready code for the `/apps/legal_discovery` module.
- Integrate with `registries/manifest.hocon` and coded tools for the legal_discovery network.
- Ensure the docker-compose stack builds and runs on Windows.
- Keep the UI polished, responsive and fully functional making at least one improvement to the asthetic every commit cycle. If there is no more room          for improvement, then you're wrong, look again and think harder, amybe even think 'bigger/ more complexity', just don't break anything.
- Log progress in this file before each commit with a short summary of work and next steps.
- ONLY IMPLEMENT PRODUCTION READY CODE. NEVER ANY MOCK/ PLACEHOLDER/ SIMULATION/ STUB/ FAKE/ TEMP/ TODO/ 'IF THIS WAS A REAL _________ (FILL IN THE BLANK), THEN....'. THE ONLY TIME THIS SORT OF PRACTICE IS ACCEPTABLE IS WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT A FEATURE OVER MULTIPLE STEPS/ ITERATIONS, AND YOU ARE STUBBING A METHOD/ FUNCTION/ API CALL/ WHATEVER. USE IT SPARINGLY, OR I WILL STOP YOU MID COMMIT AND MAKE YOU FIX IT. thank you, sorry for yelling, carry on. BUT NOT WITH MOCK CODE!!!

Major Progress Milestones
Testing & Environment:
Installed all required Python/Node dependencies for development and testing (pytest, coverage, linting, React bundle via Vite). Confirmed all tests pass before major changes.

Docker & Cross-Platform Support:
Dockerfile and docker-compose refactored for multi-stage builds and Windows compatibility. React frontend assets built during image creation; Node is only required at build time.
PostgreSQL and Chroma integrated for data persistence and vector search.

UI & Frontend:
Migrated dashboard to React for modular, modern UI.
Introduced tabs for team tools, case management, upload pipeline, metrics, and graph/timeline exports.
Glassy neon-blue dark theme with design tokens and Figma export.

Backend & API:
Added Flask API endpoints for document analysis, subpoena/presentation, task management, metrics, and graph queries.
Hardened file ingestion pipeline:

Batch uploads, per-file timeouts, parallel workers
Skipped/errored files logged, UI progress shown
Metadata normalization and retry logic for vector DB
Agent/Tool Integration:
Coded tools (redaction, Bates stamping, vector search, AAOSA pattern) exposed via REST endpoints.
Manifest and LLM config paths standardized for container startup.

Key Recent Updates
Implemented background agent initialization for responsive Flask API.
Hardened uploads: timeout, deduplication, error logging, vector/graph sync.
Refined dashboard: team tabs, case cards, metrics, progress bars, modals.
PostgreSQL & Chroma services added to docker-compose.
All startup scripts and environment variables documented in memory_bank.md.
Setup and build instructions documented; bundle.js removed from version control.
Typical Next Steps (Pattern)
Polish UI/UX and theme consistency.
Monitor/optimize upload and ingestion workflows.
Ensure Docker Compose and local workflows stay in sync.
Expand API/documentation for new features or agents.
For full details on any specific feature, agent, or deployment step, see the latest detailed entry before this summary or check memory_bank.md
