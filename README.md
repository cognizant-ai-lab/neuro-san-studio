## What is Neuro SAN?

[**Neuro AI system of agent networks (Neuro SAN)**](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san) is an open-source,
data-driven multi-agent orchestration framework designed to simplify and accelerate the development of collaborative AI
systems. It allows users—from machine learning engineers to business domain experts—to quickly build sophisticated
multi-agent applications without extensive coding, using declarative configuration files (in HOCON format).

Neuro SAN enables multiple large language model (LLM)-powered agents to collaboratively solve complex tasks, dynamically
delegating subtasks through adaptive inter-agent communication protocols. This approach addresses the limitations inherent
to single-agent systems, where no single model has all the expertise or context necessary for multifaceted problems.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🗂️ Data-Driven Configuration**: Entire agent networks are defined declaratively via simple HOCON files, empowering
technical and non-technical stakeholders to design agent interactions intuitively.
* **🔀 Adaptive Communication ([AAOSA Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9812015))**: Agents autonomously determine how
to delegate tasks, making interactions fluid and dynamic with decentralized decision-making.
* **🔒 Sly-Data**: Sly Data facilitates safe handling and transfer of sensitive data between agents without exposing it
directly to any language models.
* **🧩 Dynamic Agent Network Designer**: Includes a meta-agent called the Agent Network Designer – essentially, an agent
that creates other agent networks. Provided as an example with Neuro SAN, it can take a high-level description of a
use-case as input and generate a new custom agent network for it.
* **🛠️ Flexible Tool Integration**: Integrate custom Python-based "coded tools," APIs, databases, and even external
agent ecosystems (Agentforce, Agentspace, CrewAI, MCP, A2A agents, LangChain tools and more) seamlessly into your agent workflows.
* **📈 Robust Traceability**: Detailed logging, tracing, and session-level metrics enhance transparency, debugging, and
operational monitoring.
* **🌐 Extensible and Cloud-Agnostic**: Compatible with a wide variety of LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Ollama,
etc.) and deployable in diverse environments (local machines, containers, or cloud infrastructures).

## Getting Started

To dive into Neuro SAN and start building your own multi-agent networks, this repository contains a collection of demos
for the [neuro-san library](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san).

You'll find comprehensive documentation, example agent networks, and tutorials to guide you through your first steps.

---

### Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san-studio
```

Go to dir:

```bash
cd neuro-san-studio
```

Ensure you have a supported version of python (e.g. 3.12 or 3.13):

```bash
python --version
```

Create a dedicated Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Source it:

* For Windows:

  ```cmd
  .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat && set PYTHONPATH=%CD%
  ```

* For Mac:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate && export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
  ```

Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**IMPORTANT**: By default, the server relies on OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model. Set the OpenAI API key and add it to your shell
configuration so it's available in future sessions.

You can get your OpenAI API key from <https://platform.openai.com/signup>. After signing up, create a new API key in the
API keys section in your profile.

**NOTE**: Replace `XXX` with your actual OpenAI API key.  
**NOTE**: This is OS dependent.

* For macOS and Linux:

  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="XXX" && echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="XXX"' >> ~/.zshrc
  ```

<!-- pyml disable commands-show-output -->
* For Windows:
    * On Command Prompt:

    ```cmd
    set OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
    ```

    * On PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="XXX"
    ```

<!-- pyml enable commands-show-output -->

Other providers such as Anthropic, AzureOpenAI, Ollama and more are supported too but will require proper setup.
Look at the `.env.example` file to set up environment variables for specific use-cases.

For testing the API keys, please refer to this [documentation](./docs/api_key.md)

### Run

Neuro SAN Studio provides a user-friendly environment to interact with agent networks.

1. Start the server and client with a single command, from the project root directory:

    ```bash
    python -m run
    ```

2. Navigate to [http://localhost:4173/](http://localhost:4173/) to access the UI.
3. (Optional) Check the logs:
   * For the server logs: `logs/server.log`
   * For the client logs: `logs/nsflow.log`
   * For the agents logs: `logs/thinking_dir/*`

Use the `--help` option to see the various config options for the `run` command:

```bash
python -m run --help
```
