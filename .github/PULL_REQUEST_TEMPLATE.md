## Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project (line length â‰¤ 119 characters)
- [ ] I have run `make lint` and `make lint-tests` (or equivalent on Windows)
- [ ] I have added docstrings to new functions, classes, and modules
- [ ] I have commented complex logic where necessary
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings or errors

## Dependencies

<!-- IMPORTANT: Read this section carefully if you're adding new dependencies -->

**Modifying `./requirements.txt`:**
- [ ] I have NOT modified `./requirements.txt`, OR
- [ ] The new dependency is useful for everyone (core functionality, not specific to one coded tool/agent network/plugin)

**If adding dependencies for a specific coded tool, agent network, or plugin:**
- [ ] I have created a dedicated `requirements.txt` file in the appropriate directory (e.g., `coded_tools/my_tool/requirements.txt`)
- [ ] I have documented the dependency requirements in the relevant documentation (README, docstrings, or `docs/`)

**Note:** Only add to the main `./requirements.txt` if the library benefits all users. For tool-specific or network-specific dependencies, use a dedicated requirements file or clearly document them.

## Documentation

- [ ] I have updated relevant documentation in `docs/`
- [ ] I have updated the README.md (if needed)
- [ ] I have added/updated HOCON configuration examples (if applicable)
- [ ] I have added inline code comments where needed
