# Music Nerd

This a very simple agent network with a single agent, used as a "Hello world!" example.
It allows to test for:
- deterministic answers
- follow-up questions

## Description

Music nerd is an agent network that can answer questions about music since the 60s.

## Example conversation:

```
Human: Which band wrote Yello Submarine?
AI: ... The Beatles ...
```
Expectation: the answer should contain "The Beatles".


Follow-up question, to check the conversation history is carried over:
```
Human: Where are they from?
AI: ... Liverpool ...
```
The answer should contain "Liverpool".
