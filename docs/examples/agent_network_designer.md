# Agent Network Designer

The **Agent Network Designer** is a multi-agent system designed to create or modify other multi-agent systems.
Simply provide the frontman agent with the name of an organization or a description of a use case, and it will:

- Design a new multi-agent system.

- Save it to your registries directory in HOCON format.

- Add it to your manifest.hocon file.

- Generate several example usage queries.

- After that, just restart your server and client to begin using the newly created agent network.

Note that

- This demo will write a file to your directory and modify your manifest.hocon file. To disable this behavior, set `WRITE_TO_FILE` to `False` in [create_agent_network_hocon.py](../../coded_tools/agent_network_designer/create_agent_network_hocon.py)

- The generated agents are not grounded by default — they only simulate grounded behavior. You can remove or edit the `demo_mode` and `instruction_prefix` settings once you connect the agents to real systems such as APIs or databases via the `Toolbox` or `MCP`.

## Description

The Agent Network Designer operates as a structured, hierarchical network, following a well-defined sequence of steps:

1. The frontman agent receives a design request and delegates it to the
[`agent_network_editor`](../../registries/agent_network_editor.hocon)
 subnetwork.
This component creates or modifies the structure (graph) of the network.

2. Next, the [`agent_network_instructions_editor`](../../registries/agent_network_instructions_editor.hocon)
 subnetwork
generates or refines the `instructions` for each agent in the network.

3. Once the structure and instructions are defined, the frontman calls the
[`agent_network_query_generator`](../../registries/agent_network_query_generator.hocon)
 subnetwork to produce example usage queries for the new agent network.

4. Finally, the [create_agent_network_hocon.py](../../coded_tools/agent_network_designer/create_agent_network_hocon.py) coded tool converts the `agent_network_definition` into a HOCON file and saves it to disk.

    The **`agent_network_definition`** is a dictionary mapping agent names to their configurations
(e.g., instructions, tools, or other agents they can call).
The tool also validates the network for issues such as disconnected nodes or missing instructions.
Any detected errors are reported back to the frontman agent, which then triggers the appropriate subnetworks to resolve them.

This system serves as an example of agent-oriented software, clearly separating where we rely on:

- LLMs — for creativity, language understanding, and generation.

- Code — for precise, machine-readable structures like HOCON agent definition files.

**Implementation Detail:**

The `sly_data` is used internally to hold and share the `agent_network_definition` object between subnetworks.

📋
Here are 3-4 sample queries illustrating the usage of the UNHCR back-office agent network:

"Can you provide a financial report for the last quarter and identify any areas where we might improve our budgeting?"

"What is the current status of the recruitment process for the new field officers? How many positions are still open?"

"Please ensure that the payroll is processed on time this month and check if there are any discrepancies from last month."

"We need to procure tents and emergency supplies for the upcoming refugee camp setup. Can you coordinate this with the supply
chain and contract specialists?"
```

## Architecture Overview

### Frontman Agent: `agent_network_designer`

The frontman agent serves as the primary entry point for all user commands and orchestrates the entire workflow of designing, constructing, and refining agent networks.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Acts as the sole external-facing interface for network creation and modification requests
- Coordinates the sequential workflow of network design, instruction refinement, and query generation
- Manages iterative refinement cycles until the network meets user requirements
- Generates final HOCON configuration files

**Available Agents/Tools:**
- `agent_network_editor` – Subnetwork for creating and modifying `agent_network_definition`
- `agent_network_query_generator` – Subnetwork for createing sample queries
- `agent_network_instructions_editor` – Subnetwork for creating and refining agent instructions
- `produce_agent_network_hocon` – Generates final HOCON output
- `get_agent_network_definition` – Retrieves current network state
- `web_search` – Researches company domains and contexts

### Subnetworks

`agent_network_editor`
- Modifies or creates the agent network structure
- Returns updated `agent_network_definition` to sly data
- Determine what agent to add or remove as well as what tools each agent will use

`agent_network_instructions_editor`
- Generates and refines instructions for individual agents
- Called after structural creation or modification
- Ensures instructions align with agent roles and network topology

`agent_network_query_generator`
- Creates 3–4 representative sample queries for the network
- Returns queries formatted for testing

### Functional Tools

The system relies on several coded tools:

#### Retrieval & Output Tools

`get_agent_network_definition`
- Retrieves the current agent network definition from sly data
- Returns both machine-readable and human-readable formats
- Able to create `agent_network_definition` from existing hocon file
by setting the file to `agent_network_hocon_file` sly data or
specifically given the hocon file name in the user prompt
- Used for state inspection throughout workflow

`produce_agent_network_hocon`
- Generates the complete HOCON-formatted configuration file by calling `create_agent_network_hocon`
- Validates the network definition for correctness and completeness
- Saves output to local registries directory
- Updates the local manifest.hocon file
- Returns errors to the frontman if the network is incomplete or invalid

### Research Tool

**`web_search`**
- Searches the web for company information, industry best practices, and domain-specific workflows
- Called to gather contextual information to use as description for creating network
- Informs network design and instruction generation

---

## Debugging Hints

- Since there are many steps, the agent may time out or hit max iterations before it finishes.
This can be prevented by setting higher `max_execution_seconds`, `max_iterations`, respectively.
- If the agent stops working mid-process, it is possible that the max token limit has been reached.
