# Retail Ops and Customer Service Assistant
The **Retail Ops and Customer Service Assistant** is a modular multi-agent system designed to streamline interactions between customers and retail operations. It simulates a comprehensive customer support department by delegating inquiries to highly focused agents across order management, product guidance, marketing promotions, and issue escalation.

This demo system is configurable and can be extended to additional domains such as inventory forecasting, supplier support, or loyalty programs.

## Description

This agent network uses a hierarchical delegation structure where a central triage agent handles all incoming inquiries and assigns them to specialized domain agents. Each agent focuses on safety, empathy, and up-to-date medical information while adhering to institutional guidelines.

- **Domain Expertise Delegation**: Specialized agents handle topics like symptoms, diagnostics, insurance, appointments, and emergencies. Sub-agents may be invoked for complex queries.
- **Human-Like Medical Support**: Conversations are contextual and emotionally sensitive, mimicking interactions with real healthcare staff.
- **Integrated Documentation Intelligence**: Agents access clinical policies and care guides using a `ClinicalDocs` tool.
- **Trusted Resource Linking**: Official links to hospital pages, condition overviews, and insurance portals are provided via the `HealthURLProvider`.
- This system uses a hierarchical, human-like interaction framework where a Customer Experience Assistant acts as the primary point of contact, determining the nature of the customer’s request and routing it to the appropriate sub-agent. Each specialized agent operates within its domain of expertise, ensuring efficient, accurate, and contextual responses.

Modular Delegation Architecture: Each inquiry is handled by a specialized sub-agent responsible for a specific retail domain. Complex queries may involve collaboration between multiple agents.

Natural Dialogue Flow: The front-line assistant handles end-to-end conversation management, ensuring fluid, friendly interactions while abstracting back-end agent coordination.

Multi-function Readiness: The assistant handles diverse operational areas—such as post-order servicing, product recommendation, and refund handling—within one cohesive framework.

Scalable Design: Additional retail functions (e.g., loyalty tracking, inventory concerns) can be seamlessly integrated by extending the agent network.
