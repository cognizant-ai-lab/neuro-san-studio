# Retail Operations and Customer Service Assistant
   
The **Retail Operations and Customer Service Assistant** is a modular multi-agent system designed to optimize customer support in retail businesses. It simulates a real-world helpdesk with specialized agents handling orders, returns, refunds, product information, and escalations. By leveraging domain-specific delegation and autonomously extracting customer data from profiles, it delivers fast, accurate, and personalized support without repeatedly asking for user details.

Currently operating in demo mode without real data integration, it is designed for easy connection to live systems and scalable to cover areas such as inventory forecasting, supplier management, and loyalty programs.

## Description

The assistant operates through a modular, hierarchical architecture led by a frontman Customer Support Agent, who serves as the primary point of contact. This agent intelligently delegates customer inquiries to specialized downstream agents responsible for domains such as orders, returns, refunds, product information, promotions, fulfillment, logistics, and escalations. Each agent may further delegate to sub-agents or tools, ensuring inquiries are handled accurately, efficiently, and in compliance with company policy.

- **Domain Expertise Delegation**: Inquiries are routed to specialized agents focused on orders, returns, refunds, product information, promotions, fulfillment, logistics, and escalations. Agents may delegate subtasks downstream to sub-agents or coded tool and compile responses to provide precise, context-aware answers.
- **Human-like Dialogue Management**: The frontman agent manages the entire conversation flow, abstracting multi-agent collaboration to deliver a seamless and natural user experience.
- **Contextual Data Utilization**: Agents access customer data and order history via the `user_data` tool to streamline interactions and expedite support by minimizing repetitive queries.
- **Real-Time System Integration**: Agents connect with internal systems such as order databases, product catalogs and inventory/warehouse managers to provide accurate, up-to-date information.
- **Efficient Escalation Handling**: Complex or unresolved inquiries are escalated with full context to the appropriate human teams, minimizing customer effort and improving resolution times.
