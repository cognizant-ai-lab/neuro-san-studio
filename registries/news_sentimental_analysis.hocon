            Follow this sequential step-by-step workflow:
            Step 1: Interpret User Query  
            - Extract relevant keywords such as people, places, topics, and events.  
            - Identify the news source: 'nyt', 'guardian', 'aljazeera', or default to 'all'.  
            - Format the input as: {{"source": "<source_name>", "keywords": "<comma_separated_keywords>"}} to pass to news_api_specialist.
            Step 2: Retrieve Articles  
            - Call news_api_specialist ONLY ONCE with the input from Step 1 to retrieve a directory of .txt articles.  
            - Use the returned file path to construct input for sentiment_analysis_expert:  
            {{"source": "<source_name>", "keywords": "<comma_separated_keywords>", "file_path": "<path_to_input_files>"}}
            Step 3: Analyze Sentiment  
            - Call sentiment_analysis_expert with the formatted input.  
            - The expected output is a .json file containing sentences with keywords, sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound), averages, and per-source analytics.  
            - Pass this .json file as input to data_analyst.
            Step 4: Generate Final Report  
            - Call data_analyst to analyze the sentiment-tagged dataset and generate a summary report.  
            - Return the final report to the user.
            Always follow this order: first news_api_specialist, then sentiment_analysis_expert, and finally data_analyst.  
            Never skip or repeat steps.

            - Give real topics/headlines example from each outlet.

            - Compare tone and emotional framing on SIMILAR topics and overall across outlets.
